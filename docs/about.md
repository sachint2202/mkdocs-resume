# ABOUT ME

Hey wonderful human! :hand_splayed:

My name is **Sachin Tiwari** and I'm thrilled to have you here on my page! 

I'm a **Senior Software Enginner** :computer: with 5 years of experience in the field, and I'm passionate about _Low-code technologies, full-stack development_ along with _Generative AI_ :robot: and _Cloud_ :cloud:.

I'm from a sweet ancient place called **Varanasi** :hindu_temple: _(Kashi or Banaras as you know it)_ in India. I completed by Bachelors from **NIT Jalandhar** :fontawesome-solid-graduation-cap: in Punjab and have since been working in **Optum(United Health Group)**. :man_in_motorized_wheelchair_facing_right_tone5:

When I'm not working, you can find me reading something, writing blogs (_you can find my articles [here](https://medium.com/@sachintiwari2)_), cooking something spicy, biking, binge watching series and leisure walking ( _not the one for exercises :laughing:_). I also enjoy spending time with my family :family:, trying out new restaurants and cuisines :shallow_pan_of_food:, and exploring my neighbourhoods :house_with_garden:.

I love listening & telling stories :statue_of_liberty:, philosophical discussions or simply irritating my siblings.

Feel free to connect with me over [Insta chats :simple-instagram:](https://www.instagram.com/classicaldobby) or just [mail me :e-mail:](mailto:sachintiwari2058@gmail.com) and let's get to know each other!

Keep finding beautiful surprises! :sunflower:

**Sachin Tiwari**
